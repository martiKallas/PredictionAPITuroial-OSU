The purpose of this project is to create a comprehensive and easy-to-follow quickstart guide
for using the Google Prediction API with javascript.

While currently under construction, the goal is to look at low-level GET and POST calls to the
API rather than to use library functions. This is to expose the fundamentals of API calls
and inform an inexperienced user.
